Birthday : June 11th 2009
Sign : Gemini

Born in Colombia, Atlantico, Barranquilla. Raised in a small town called Palmar de Varela (which is full of stupid people)

Esteban was a shy guy, but after 2022 he started gaining way more confidence

Esteban is a _Cartoon Network_ fan, mainly a fan of _adventure time_ and _Steven Universe_ because of their interesting lore, characters and overall quality. He also is an artist, both digital and traditional, he is someone with good taste in most things, these being architecture, art, and clothing, he likes and specific aesthetic of vintage+modern, or any aesthetic similar to steampunk or dystopian. He was also [[Sebastian]]'s first partner. Being a _Cartoon Network_ fan was what make him and [[Sebastian]] be close friends quickly before actually having a romantic relationship

Even tho they did established a romantic relationship, they still saw each other as close friends, and after breaking up virtually nothing changed, they both saw each other as good friends only during all the relationship even tho they kissed and did other "romantic relationship exclusive" stuff. This is kind of confusing to explain since even tho it sounds like just being friends with benefits, they still saw each other as more than that.

His main friends are 

> [[Fiorella]]
> [[Valleleth]]

After 2023 Esteban "stopped" being pansexual, saying it was only a phase.

Esteban used to have a secret crush on [[Fiorella]]. No one knows how long has Esteban been in love with her. Esteban and [[Fiorella]] know each other since elementary, they were always in the same schools. His "love" was based mainly on jealousy, he says.
