## notes and extra info

Jayden is one of [[Jhonny]]'s closest friends. Jayden always tries to help [[Jhonny]] with his internal problems. In [[Jhonny]]'s own words, Jayden is like a big brother to him. Jayden seemed to know about [[Jhonny]]'s crush on him, but didn't do anything about it until he got in his relationship with [[Jiali]].


Jayden has confirmed two times he is bisexual, first he told [[Sebastian]], Jayden was still new in the school when he told him, though Jayden doesn't want to admit he ever told this to [[Sebastian]]. The second time he did was with [[Jhonny]] and [[Eliesser]], they were in a park, alone, and Jayden decided to tell them. When he told them he also said that even though he is bisexual he still doesn't want to be in a relationship with a man yet, and wants to keep his bisexuality a secret. According to [[Jhonny]], even after telling this to him and [[Eliesser]] he still doesn't want to entirely admit it and keeps saying it was a joke.

Jayden rarely opens up to anyone, since he
apparently believes he doesn't need it, he has only
opened up to the [[main group of 2023-2024]], but still
hasn't told anyone his feelings in their entirety.
