Birthday : September 22th 2006
Born in Venezuela, then moved to Colombia, then to the United States.

Jhonny is a guy who tries hiding his true feelings, sadness, very poorly. I consider his personality very interesting because of that.

Jhonny rarely opens up to someone unless he trusts them completely, or if they show him they are mature enough to help him with his problems. The only people he tells his greater problems are [[Jayden]], and [[Sebastian]].

Jhonny is an anime fan, and a Minecraft player, he plays Minecraft with his friends [[Eliesser]], [[Jiali]] and [[Jayden]] often.

Jhonny also draws a lot, he's good with coloring but not so good at proportions. His style is mainly based on Dragon Ball, because he is a fan of the anime since he was little.

His main friends are 

>[[Jayden]]
>[[Eliesser]]

He is part of the [[main group of 2023-2024]]

Jhonny has a secret crush on [[Jayden]], he only told this to [[Sebastian]] on the summer of 2024 and, then he told [[Karen]] on 2025 before she left to go back to Colombia.

Jhonny has 2 siblings, he is the older sibling.

Jhonny went through big problems in his house, since his dad is a violent person, and his mom seems to be a little attached to him. In order to protect his siblings, his mom, and himself he had to "mature".

Jhonny has a WhatsApp channel he uses as his personal blog, uploading screenshots of Minecraft gameplay, drawings and poems he made.

Most of his poems are direct vents about how sad he feels, and also about his situation with [[Jayden]] and other things.

Jhonny knows that [[Jayden]] is in a relationship with [[Jiali]]. He has said that this has hurt his relationship with Jayden, since he's being busier and distant with him, but he decides to suffer in silence to not bother [[Jayden]]. He has been distant with [[Jiali]] ever since she and [[Jayden]] got together, though their relationship is not the only reason Jhonny is distant. He feels like it's better to do this rather than talk about it, since none of them would understand. He tries his best to hide his emotions, but at the same time he's in a constant state of vulnerability.

On May 23th 2025 [[Jayden]] decided to reach out for Jhonny, but in doing so, he also demonstrated how selfish he was, not because he was trying to reach out, but because of the reasons, and the way he was doing it. In the end Jhonny started considering just leaving from his life.

On May 24th 2025 he decided he would separate from [[Jayden]] entirely, .

On May 27th 2025 at 5:23 a guy whose name is still unknown for me, besides the small hint of his name starting with "[[Chris]]", Jhonny told him they could try something out.
