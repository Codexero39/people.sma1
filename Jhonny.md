## basic information

Birthday : September 22th 2006
Sign : Virgo
Born in Venezuela, then moved to Colombia, then to the United States.

Jhonny is a guy who tries hiding his true feelings, sadness, very poorly. I consider his personality very interesting because of that.

Jhonny rarely opens up to someone unless he trusts them completely, or if they show him they are mature enough to help him with his problems. The only people he tells his greater problems are [[Jayden]], and [[Sebastian]].

## notes and extra info

Former member of the [[main group of 2023-2024]]

Jhonny is an anime fan, and a Minecraft player, he plays Minecraft with his friends [[Eliesser]], [[Jiali]] and [[Jayden]] often.

Jhonny also draws a lot, he's good with coloring but not so good at proportions. His style is mainly based on Dragon Ball, he has been an anime fan since he was little.

Jhonny had a secret crush on [[Jayden]], he only told this to [[Sebastian]] on the summer of 2024 and, then he told [[Karen]] on 2025 before she left to go back to Colombia.

Jhonny has 2 siblings, he is the older sibling.

Jhonny went through big problems in his house, since his dad is a violent person, and his mom seems to be a little attached to him. In order to protect his siblings, his mom, and himself he had to become more "mature".

Jhonny has a WhatsApp channel he uses as his personal blog, uploading screenshots of Minecraft gameplay, memes, drawings, and poems he made.

Most of his poems are direct vents about how sad he feels about all the problems he has.

Jhonny knows that [[Jayden]] is in a relationship with [[Jiali]]. He had said that this had hurt his relationship with Jayden, since he was getting busier and distant with him, but he decides to stay silent to not bother [[Jayden]]. He has been distant with [[Jiali]] ever since she and [[Jayden]] got together, though their relationship is not the only reason Jhonny is distant from them. He feels like it's better to do this rather than talk about it, since none of them would understand. He tries his best to hide his emotions, but at the same time he also appears to be in a constant state of vulnerability.

On May 23th 2025 [[Jayden]] decided to reach out for Jhonny, but in doing so, he also demonstrated how selfish he was, not because he was trying to reach out, but because of the reasons, and the way he was doing it. In the end Jhonny started considering just leaving the group.

On May 24th 2025 he decided he would separate from the [[main group of 2023-2024]] entirely, keeping some connections.

On May 27th 2025 at 5:23 a guy whose name is still unknown for me, besides the small hint of his name starting with "[[Chris]]", Jhonny told him they could try something out.
