## notes and extra info

She is currently in a relationship with [[Jayden]]. In her own words their relationship is very normal, there are no unspoken problems between the two of them. [[Jayden]] was the one who asked Jiali out, she first hesitated to decide if she would accept him, since she knew that [[Jhonny]] liked him, but after less than two weeks she accepted to be in a relationship with [[Jayden]]. She knew about [[Jhonny]]'s feelings since 2024, in her own words "it was really obvious". Jiali sees [[Jhonny]] as a good friend, but they became distant after she got with [[Jayden]], she feels like he's jealous.

Jiali knows about [[Jayden]] secret bisexuality. When she asked him about it he said he was straight. Just a day after they talked about it, [[Sebastian]] decided to talk about it too, he did not know that Jayden and Jiali talked about a day after. She is convinced [[Jayden]] is bisexual, but she says she does not care if he lies about it right now because their relationship is still recent, and hopes he talks about it with her in the future.
