## partner situation

She was in a relationship with [[Eric]] though there were always issues with him. [[Eric]] hides most of his past from Kamilah, which has caused a lot of discussion, since Kamilah always tells everything to [[Eric]] and she expected him to feel the same reliability towards her. 

On May 28th 2025 they broke up. This happened because Kamilah's mom didn't want her to be in a relationship yet. Though, in the same day while in school, when Kamilah saw [[Eric]] in the hallways he kissed her like if nothing had happened before.

## Eric and  Kamilah

Kamilah and him talked about each other's past relationships when they first got together, so both of them could understand each other's situation and just to assure it was safe to date each other. [[Eric]] told Kamilah he had broke up with his ex around April 2024, summer, and they had not had contact after that

[[Eric]] is someone who clearly has a phone addiction problem, using it in class every time he can, and even if he can't. Because of this, he gives his phone to Kamilah so she keeps it away from him from 1st period until 7th/8th period.

Since [[Eric]] did not care about what she did with his phone Kamilah usually played games in his phone during Lunch (to not waste her own phone's battery). One day she decided to actually check it, chats and gallery, and she discovered that he had (at that moment) recently deleted a LOT of pictures. Some pictures were just old memes, but most of them were screenshots of chats, the most alarming showing a chat of [[Eric]]'s ex texting him she was pregnant, and the date of the screenshot showed "April 2024", around the same time [[Eric]] said he broke up with his ex. Most screenshots had a lot to do with his ex, and it also showed chats with other girls, in the chat screenshots we could see romantic attraction between the two people, Kamilah and the whole group infered that [[Eric]] was cheating on his ex with multiple girls. Though most screenshots were cropped, the group stimated that he was talking to at least three different girls. In the end, when Kamilah talked with [[Eric]] about what she found, he said that his ex being pregnant was an April fools joke, and that the other screenshots were actually his friends asking [[Eric]] for relationship advice. This whole problem is considered what ended the "New relationship" phase between the couple, making Kamilah be a little bit more skeptical about what [[Eric]] said before.

Kamilah's mom was apparently always against Kamilah's and [[Eric]]'s relationship, though it seems that there was a time when Kamilah's mom started tolerating the relationship more, she recently has demonstrated she is totally against it, since she told Kamilah to break up with [[Eric]], putting what, right now, seems to be an end to their relationship.
