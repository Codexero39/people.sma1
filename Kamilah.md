## notes and extra info

She is in a relationship with [[Eric]] though there is always issues with him. [[Eric]] hides most of his past from Kamilah, which has caused a lot of discussion, since Kamilah always tells everything to [[Eric]] and she expects him to feel the same reliability towards her. 

On May 28th 2025 they broke up. This happened because Kamilah's mom didn't want her to be in a relationship yet. Though, in the same day while in school, when Kamilah saw [[Eric]] in the hallways he kissed her like if nothing had happened before.

## Eric and Kamilah

Kamilah and him talked about each other's past relationships when they first got together, so both of them could understand each other's situation and just to assure it was safe to date each other. 

[[Eric]] is someone who clearly has a phone addiction problem, using it in class every time he can, and even if he can't. Because of this, he gives his phone to Kamilah so she keeps it away from him from 1st period until 7th/8th period.

Since [[Eric]] did not care about what she did with his phone Kamilah usually played games in his phone during Lunch (to not waste her own phone's battery). One day she decided to actually check it, chats and gallery, and she discovered that he had (at that moment)  recently deleted a LOT of pictures
