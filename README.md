# Introduction
Heyyy, Samuel here, this is a documentation i did of almost all the people i know. it will keep updating with time. this personal project is meant to be private since i dont actually want my friends' secrets spread across the internet, if i share this to you please treat this project with respect.
> So.

this project is meant to be as accurate as possible, and im trying to be neutral with it to keep it genuine and direct. if youre one of the people i have share this with and you  think something has been wrongly interpreted please tell me right away, this is supposed to be an accurate documentation not my journal!
