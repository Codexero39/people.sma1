## basic information

Born in Ecuador, then moved to the US when she was 7-8

Rebecca is a really resilient person, with remarkable academic achievements, such as getting the unreal grade average of 101 in her report card two times. She's part of the [[National Honor Society]], a group conformed of honor students. She also does a lot of community work besides the big amount of school work she already does, which makes her be tired all the time.

Rebecca is also the best basketball player in her gym class, and the best volleyball player, and honestly the best at almost every sport.

I don't have the knowledge of who her other main friends are, this will probably get updated soon

## notes and extra info

Rebecca is part of the [[main group of 2024-2025]] and technically the creator of it.

Even though Rebecca clearly has natural leadership skills based on her academic achievements, she is a very reserved person, and very introverted.

Rebecca is an _ENA_ fan, which is the reason [[Sebastian]] gained interest in being her friend, since he also liked the series a lot.
