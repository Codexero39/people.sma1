Birthday : October 27th 2009
Sign : Scorpio

Born in Venezuela, Caracas, South America 
Raised in the city of caracas for 7 years and then moved to Colombia, to then move again when he was 13 to the United States to have a better academic life.

Sebastian is a guy who has always wanted to have a lot of friends, or at least someone he can actually rely on, making him a bit clingy when he detects the most minimum sense of reliability on a person. He seeks for people who can understand him, and he also seeks to understand people, and he makes that very clear to the people he believes have the same desire for someone who understands them. This makes people easily open up to him (if they actually seek to be understood) like [[Jhonny]] and [[Zhaele]].

He is good with logic, stuff that can be predicted, and numbers in general.

He used to make super simple games during 2021-early 2023, first with an old phone, and then with a semi modern 2014 computer that had almost zero positive features since it was modified for someone without his consent.

His main friends currently are

>[[Esteban]]
>[[Kamilah]]
>[[Rebecca]]
>[[Zhaele]]
>[[Lindsay]]
>[[Bryant]]
>[[Miguel G]]
>[[Emily B]]

And some more, they are not necessarily in any specific order, nor they are in one compact group but rather in small connections, they all know a little bit of each other, but no one knows anyone completely or enough to be close friends.

Sebastian is not someone very serious, since he often tends to joke about everything, but not being serious doesn't make him "funny" just unserious in a weird way. He is constantly reminded of this by the [[main group of 2024-2025]].

Sebastian was bullied by his old friend group ([[main group of 2023-2024]]) which is the reason he left it and stopped being close friends with some of the members of it.

He is a very curious guy, reason why he decided to investigate all of his main friends (and some secondary friends) life's. He wants to learn as much as he can about them.
