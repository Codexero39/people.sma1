## notes and extra info

Zhaele's dad died when she was little, Zhaele misses him a lot, she accepts the fact that his death still affects her and she lets it make her sad occasionally.

Zhaele grew up in a troubled household, her parents were always fighting which made dissociating a daily, almost normalized, thing. This made her have personality issues, which she describes as suddenly going auto pilot, not having thoughts, not feeling alive, but still feeling. This dissociation happens often, she says, Zhaele seeks for ways to feel alive often to avoid being depressed, feeling fake.

Zhaele doesn't talk a lot about this topic with people, because she fears not being taken seriously, reason why you need to show her you're a reliable person before actually asking any questions.
