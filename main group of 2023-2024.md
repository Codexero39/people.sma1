Originally called the "yippee squad", this group was made by [[Sebastian]] as a WhatsApp group chat to talk with his only two friends at the time [[Valentina]] and [[Yandel]].
[[Yandel]] told [[Sebastian]] to add [[Jhonny]].

After [[Jhonny]], other people started joining to the group, these being [[Jayden]], [[Jiali]], [[Eliesser]], [[Crhistian]], [[Mikaela]], and [[Karen]]

The group eventually started dissolving when [[Crhistian]] moved to Chicago, then [[Sebastian]] left it to join the [[main group of 2024-2025]], [[Mikaela]] moved to New Jersey, and lastly [[Karen]] moved back to Colombia.

Then [[Sebastian]] left because he was really unhappy with the remaining people of the group, since they were bullying him since they got into the group

On may 23th 2025 [[Jhonny]] started considering abandoning the group because of how [[Jayden]] and [[Jiali]] were treating him around that time

The group still exists today, only conformed by [[Eliesser]], [[Jhonny]], [[Jiali]] and [[Jayden]].
