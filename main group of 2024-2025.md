The main group of 2025 consists of very few people, these being [[Rebecca]], [[Sebastian]], [[Kamilah]], [[Zhaele]], and [[Lindsay]]

They are the "main" group of 2025 because they had lunch period together but also because they all helped each other in any way they could making them being really close

[[Rebecca]] and [[Sebastian]] were the firsts "members" of the main group of 2025, they met in health class, and then [[Sebastian]] asked [[Rebecca]] if they could go to the library together, because [[main group of 2023-2024]] was starting to annoy him a lot more than usual.

In the library they both realized they had a lot in common (even tho some aspect of their personalities are entirely different) so they started hanging out

 After a while [[Sebastian]] started telling [[Rebecca]] to go the cafeteria instead of the library, because he was eating poorly at the homeless shelter he lived at, so they started going there almost every day.

One day there was a fire drill during lunch period, and outside the school [[Rebecca]] and [[Sebastian]] met [[Kamilah]].

Then after 1 month [[Kamilah]] brought [[Zhaele]] to our table, but she didn't talk much with the group, only with Kamilah

Around September and December [[Lindsay]] also joined the group, being the last member of the group.
